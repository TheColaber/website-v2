      <title>About Persistant Scripts</title>

      <description>What are they? Persistent scripts allow you to run JavaScript in the background! They&amp;rsquo;re awesome to notify the user about stuff, or preload data so it&amp;rsquo;s ready when the user needs it.
How do I add a persistent script? Make sure to refresh Scratch Addons from chrome://extensions after doing any changes to your addon.
Go to the manifest of your addon (addon.json) and add a property called &amp;quot;persistent_scripts&amp;quot;.
This property must be an array, even if your addon will only use one persistent script.</description>

      <description>What are they? Userscripts allow you to run code along Scratch pages - you can do stuff like add buttons, enhance the Scratch editor, or anything you can imagine.
How do I add a userscript? Make sure to refresh Scratch Addons from chrome://extensions after doing any changes to your addon.
Go to the manifest of your addon (addon.json) and add a property called userscripts&amp;quot;.
This property must be an array.</description>

      <description>What are they? Userstyles allows you to inject CSS on the Scratch website - useful to make the buttons you add with userscripts colorful, or to customize native Scratch element.
How do I add a userstyle? Make sure to refresh Scratch Addons from chrome://extensions after doing any changes to your addon.
Go to the manifest of your addon (addon.json) and add a property called &amp;quot;userstyles&amp;quot;.
This property must be an array.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s an addon, really? Actually, an addon isn&amp;rsquo;t much more than a combination of at least one of these: persistent scripts, userscripts and userstyles. If any of these are related, then we make them part of the same addon, under a single name. For example, the &amp;ldquo;Scratch 3 Developer Tools&amp;rdquo; addon has a userscript in charge of adding a find box to the editor, and a userstyle that adds CSS to that box.</description>

      <guid>/docs/developing/addon.tab.traps/</guid>
      <description>This page is out of date and is in need of a rewrite. If you know anything about traps, please contribute! addon.tab.traps is a public API for userscripts that can be used to obtain objects that are not otherwise available. The actual traps are coded at prototype-handler.
They share some APIs with &amp;ldquo;Once&amp;rdquo; traps, but is very different and is documented at Fake redux state separately.
Examples editor-stepping addon shows how to manipulate Thread object trapped.</description>

      <description>Required software: text editor, Chrome.
If possible, disable the Scratch Addons extension you downloaded from the store before proceeding to avoid issues.
Step 1: Read about addon basics Make sure to read that article to be familiar with the terminology.
Step 2: Fork/clone the repo Or download as ZIP, if you want. In other words, just download the source code locally.
Step 3: Load the extension into Chrome Note: Chrome is recommended for working on addons.</description>

Colors Our color theme is orange #ff7b26 and white #fff. These colors make up the top bar on our webpages, as well as some other elements.
For our (default) dark theme, our main colors are #2a2a2a #222 #000.</description>

      <description>Already translated: Japanese and Spanish. We won&amp;rsquo;t be accepting any new translators for these languages
Thanks for being interested on volunteering to translate Scratch Addons to other languages! Scratch Addons is a non-profit open source project where volunteer web developers maintain the extension and create its addons.
Even if you haven&amp;rsquo;t ever coded a single line of JavaScript, you can still help us achieve our goal of making everyone&amp;rsquo;s experience with Scratch better!</description>

      <description>Localizing addons is easy.
Adding messages Under addons-l10n/en/, make a file named ADDONID.json, where ADDONID is the addon&amp;rsquo;s ID (the folder name). Write your messages that you want to translate there:
{ &amp;#34;ADDONID/meow&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;Meow&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;ADDONID/cats&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;{number, plural, one {1 cat} other {# cats}}&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;ADDONID/eat&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;I want to eat {food}!&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;ADDONID/salmon&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;salmon&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;ADDONID/sardine&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;sardine&amp;#34; } Placeholders Sometimes messages need to have things that are dynamically generated. For example, number of cats, or input.</description>

      <description>Scratch Addons supports getting and modifying Redux state!
Keep in mind  Redux only applies on new page (ones with new navigation bar, including editor) Some extensions conflict with ScratchAddons&#39; Redux feature. Do not use this when unnecessary. We expect readers to have basic knowledge on Redux and Scratch&amp;rsquo;s reducers.  Get redux state addon.tab.redux.state stores current Redux state. For example, to get message count: addon.tab.redux.state.messageCount.messageCount
Events addon.tab.redux.addEventListener(&amp;quot;statechanged&amp;quot;, callback) to add event listeners for state changes.</description>
